## 🔍 What Is Super People 2 Wallhack?

Wallhack, aka **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)**, is a visual cheat that overlays critical info on your screen while you play. It shows you **enemy player outlines**, **loot positions**, **player names**, **health bars**, and more—even when they’re behind solid objects.

This means no more jump scares, no more ambushes, and **no more guesswork** when clearing buildings.
